## Fault salt bounary interpretation with optimal path picking

This repository contains computer programs written and used by 
[Xinming Wu](http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/wu/) 
for 2D and 3D horizon extraction that is discussed in our Geophysics paper 
[Fault salt bounary interpretation with optimal path picking]
(http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/wu/files/wu2018FastSaltBoundaryInterpretationWithOptimalPathPicking.pdf).

This software depends on that in the [Mines Java Toolkit
(JTK)](https://github.com/dhale/jtk/). If you want to do more than browse the
source code, you must first download and build the Mines JTK using
[Gradle](http://www.gradle.org). The build process for software in
this repository is the same.

Like the Mines JTK, this is a toolkit for computer programmers. It is not a
complete system for seismic interpretation of geologic horizons. Others
(including commercial software companies) have built such systems using
earlier versions of one or more of the software tools provided in this
repository.

### Summary

Here are brief descriptions of key components:

#### OptimalPathPicker
Implements the algorithm of optimal path picking

#### SaltBoundaryPicker2
Implements the interactive 2D salt boundary picker

#### run a test
cd src/sbp/

type ../../j sbp.SaltBoundaryPicker2 to run the 2D demo
